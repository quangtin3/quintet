<h3>Quintet</h3>

<u>What is it ?</u>

This is a fork of <a href='http://code.google.com/p/jquery-form-builder-plugin/'>jquery-form-builder-plugin</a> by <a href='https://github.com/limcheekin'>limcheekin</a>, the intent is to use

1) jQuery
2) jQuery UI
3) Bootstrap

to produce

4) Forms
5) Views

hence 'Quintet'.

Furthermore, this code should stand on it's own, when Quintet detects that it is
host from 'file://' it should use localData as a database. One should be able to
take this code and start connecting to any backend.

<u>Status</u>

That early stadium where everything is still described as 'should'.

<u>Todo</u>

The todo can be found in the root ( TODO.txt )

<u>Philosophy</u>

The same set of javascript files should be used for form building, view building
and actually serving the forms and views. Adding new widgets is done through new
quintet.<widget>.js files, preferably starting from cloning quintet.singlefieldtext.js

Every widget registers itself, so there should be no need to make any changes in
quintet.js. For now, a button needs to be added to quintet.html, the list of the
buttons should become generated at some point.

There is a departure from the original in that some features have been left out 
as 'gold plating'. ( Font color .. )

Also the coding style is different; more white space, comments and sprintf magic
with innerHTML instead of using DOM manipulation. Indented with two spaces, you
will notice from the commits that I violate this rule quite frequently. I blame 
my text editors..

This makes the code much more approachable IMHO, we will see how that works out.

Finally, Quintet is supposed to be work in tandem with a backend, this is not in
scope for this project. All communication with that backend should be done using
the JSON format because it is awesome and the future.

<u>Required functions and properties for a widget</u>

* createOptions()
* createOptionsUI()
* create()
* update() &lt;- TODO
* id

<u>The structure of forms</u>

A form consists out of 1 or more '.contentRow' table rows. These rows are either
'.section.widget' section headers or contain '.widgetColumn' columns. These have
0 or more widgets. The top level div for widgets has no specific class assigned.
Only when in design mode, each widget must have haven an 'X' button to remove it
from the form. The final requirement for a widget is an '#options" div which has
all data required to construct the widget anew. These options are Base64 encoded
in order to avoid nasty XSS hacks and unicode trouble on the database end. I use
the functions atob and btoa for this, which means that Quintet wont work with IE
until that is fixed by the folks in Redmond or you can use <a href="http://code.google.com/p/stringencoders/source/browse/trunk/javascript/base64.js">this</a>.

<u>Thoughts on DRY</u>

The code violates DRY in several places, this is done to force compartmentalized
widget code. Feel free to create github issues for DRY violations outside of the
widget classes. One particular is <b>quintet.widget.current</b> which is a 'global' var
in that totally disconnected pieces of code use it.
